This is built using a basic sample / quickstart application for **Elastos Trinity**. 

It's based on a simple ionic HTML5 tab application, but it also contains a default manifest file ready and is therefore 
ready to be packaged as a EPK file (Elastos Trinity package format), and ran inside the Trinity application (you have to 
install that application first on your mobile device).

Read more on [the Elastos developer website](https://developer.elastos.org) to learn more about building and running 
your own Trinity applications.
